# twlottomldl
My part-time experimental project. Using machine learning and deep learning to predict lottery numbers.\
Kick-off: 2020/05/11
## Data:
- Historical lottery data
- Weather data
## Approach
0. Background: 
    - Purpose: mainly act as a tentative project for practicing Deep Learning techniques
    - Lottery rules
    - 
1. Web scraping: Use python/pyquery to scrape the data from websites.
    - Major challenge(s): Website structure parsing, Python multi-processing.
2. Data prep.: Use python/pandas to correctly join the data from different sources according to the dates.
    - Major challenge(s): date/time format
    - NULL values
3. ML/ DL: 
    - Training data: Year 2019(and/or before)
    - Testing data: Year 2020
    - Major challenge(s): Model comparison
    - TBD
4. WebApp deployment: TBD
